 Name: Animal Horde
School\Sphere: My School designation is Nature
Tier: 9
Range: 0
Components: [is always Spell Name] V , [Draw the called animals on the ground] S , [Holy symbol of deity being prayed to] M 
Duration:  24 hours
Casting Time: 90 Seconds
Area of Effect: 10-mile radius
Effects of Spell:  
Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory:  None
Critical: None
Description: This potent spell summons a number of animals to the caster.
The Power who grants the spell enables the caster to know exactly what types and 
numbers of animals are within the area of effect. The animals will begin arriving in 
30 seconds and all of them will have arrived after 3 minutes.
The animals will not fight among each other even if they are natural enemies. 
Monsters (dragons, gorgons, hell hounds, etc.) cannot be summoned with this spell.
The summoned animals will aid the priest in any means of which they are capable. 
They will enter battle, protect the caster and his companions, or perform a specified 
mission until the caster dismisses them or the spell expires. During this time, the caster 
can automatically communicate with his animals.
At the end of the spell, the animals instinctively return to their lairs. For the first three 
minutes after the spell expires, the animals will not attack the caster, his companions, or 
other summoned animals. After this time, the animals will behave normally.

 Name: Astral Spell
School\Sphere: Evocation (My School Arcane)
Tier: 9 
Range: Touch 
Components: [Astral Spell] V , [Nodding head as if going to sleep] S , [none] M 
Duration: Until Cancelled, or Player Logs Out 
Casting Time: 9 seconds 
Area of Effect: Caster and up to 7 others 
Effects of Spell: Allows the Caster to enter the Astral plane, and the various elemental planes.  
Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory: None 
Critical: None
Description: By means of the astral spell, a caster can project his astral body into the Astral Plane,
leaving his physical body and material possessions behind in the Prime Material Plane.
Only magical items can be brought into the Astral Plane. As the Astral Plane touches upon the first levels of all of the Outer Planes, the wizard can travel astrally to any of the Outer Planes at will. The caster then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body in the plane of existence he has chosen to enter. It is also possible to
travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a
second body cannot be formed in the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected can be seen only by creatures in the Astral Plane. At all times, the astral body is connected to the material body by a soul cord. If the cord is broken, the cord simply returns to the original body where it rests in the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function in the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing in the Astral Plane. Any magical items can go into the Astral Plane, but most become temporarily nonmagical therein, or in any planes removed from the Prime Material Plane. Artifacts and relics function anywhere. Items drawing their power from a given plane are more powerful in that plane.

School\Sphere: Fire
Tier:  9
Range:  200 yards
Components: [is always Spell Name] V , [Varies] S , [Varies] M 
Duration:  3 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 60-foot-radius hemisphere
Effects of Spell: 
 Friendly Effects:  They are healed for 1d6 hit points, gain the benefit of an aid spell for 1 turn after the circle of sunmotes is created, 
 gain +1 bonuses to all attack and damage rolls, and gain a +2 bonus to morale. Allies who step within 10 feet of the glowing miniature sun at the 
 center of the effect are healed of 3-10 hit points. This affects each creature only once during the spell's duration. 
 Creatures affected by the faerie fire suffer a -2 penalty to armor class from attacks by creatures outside the circle, suffer a -2 penalty to missile attacks against them.                   
 Hostile Effects: They must save versus spell or be blinded for 1 turn after the sunmotes are 
 created. Each enemy is struck by a small fiery mote causing 1d4+1 points of damage (no 
 saving throw is allowed, but creatures with magical fire resistance suffer only half 
 damage), and suffers a -2 penalty to morale. those hostile who come within 10 feet of the minisun are burned for 3-10 
 points of fire damage. 
Saving Throw: none
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory:  None
Critical: None
Description: By casting circle of sunmotes, the caster creates a hemispherical shell filled with 
 sparkling, glowing motes of bright sunlight. A one-foot radius globe of sunlight appears 
 at the height of the caster's head in the exact center of the circle.
 Those who are allies of the caster experience the glowing motes as warm, invigorating, inspiring, and healing. Companions of the caster who are outside the area of effect view enemies    
 within the circle as if they are affected by golden faerie fire.
 Those who are hostile to the caster experience the same sunmotes as blinding, burning, and damaging. Enemies of the priest outside the circle view the priest's allies as if obscured by a 
 blinding light

 Name: Conformance
School\Sphere: Arcane
Tier: 9 
Range:  0
Components: [is always Spell Name] V , [Varies] S , [Varies] M 
Duration:  6 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 80-foot-diameter sphere
Effects of Spell:  events with a probability of 51% or better always occur, while improbable actions (those with less than a 50% chance) always fail.
Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory:  None
Critical: None
Description: The conformance spell has a simple principle with a profound effect: probable events 
always manifest. There are two conditions that affect this spell. First, a prayer spell is continuously 
operative in the area of effect, shifting the balance of combat probabilities toward the 
favor of the priest who casts this spell and his companions. Second, probabilities of 
exactly 50% always shift in favor of the spellcasting priest. This spell is particularly potent if bless and chant spells are cast in the area of effect.

 Name: Crushing Hand
School\Sphere: Arcane
Tier: 9 
Range: 5 meters/level 
Components: [Crushing Hand] V , [Varies] S , [a glove of snake skin and the shell of an egg] M 
Duration: 10 Seconds 
Casting Time: 9 Seconds
Area of Effect: Target
Effects of Spell:  The damage inflicted depends on the number of seconds it acts upon the victim:
 1st second 10 points
 2nd & 3rd seconds 20 points
 4th second & beyond 40 points
  
Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory: None 
Critical: None
Description: The Crushing Hand spell creates a huge, disembodied hand. The crushing hand is under the mental control of the caster, and he can cause it to grasp and squeeze an opponent. No attack roll is necessary; the hand automatically grasps and inflicts constriction damage on the target. The crushing hand has an Armor class of 0, has as many hit points as its caster at full strength, and vanishes when destroyed. The hand is susceptible to normal combat attacks and damaging spells, but if it is struck by an area-effect spell, the person held suffers the
same fate as the hand (i.e., if the hand fails its saving throw, the victim automatically fails
his). The hand is not effective against noncorporeal or gaseous forms, but it does prevent creatures that are able to slip through small cracks from escaping. If the hand grasps an item or construction, the appropriate saving throw must be made as if squeezed by a Strength of 25.

 Name: Greater Health Blessing 
School\Sphere: Divine
Tier: 9 
Range: 100 meters
Components: [Greater Health Blessing] V , [Clasp Hands as if praying] S , [Any unused bandage] M

Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory:  None

 Name: Implosion/Inversion
School\Sphere: Arcane
Tier: 9
Range: 120 meters
Components: [Implosion/Inversion] V , [Varies] S , [Varies] M 
Duration: 1-3 minutes 
Casting Time: 40 seconds
Area of Effect: One or more creatures
Effects of Spell: The result is that the rearrangement of the target creature causes it to implode (collapse inward upon itself) or invert (its 
insides become its outsides and vice versa). The result is usually inversion, unless the target would not be adversely affected by 
this process (e.g., a slime, ooze, golem, elemental, etc.). In this case, implosion takes 
place. In either case, the effect kills/destroys the target instantaneously unless it makes a 
successful saving throw versus death magic at a -4 penalty. The caster can affect one creature per minute with this spell. After each round, the 
caster must make a Constitution check. If this fails, the caster is overwhelmed with the 
effort of sustaining the spell, at which time the spell terminates, leaving the caster
 stunned for 1-4 minutes. The maximum possible duration of the spell is 3 minutes.  
Saving Throw: -4 penalty
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory: None
Critical: None
Description: By use of this spectacular spell, the caster rearranges the extradimensional and spatial 
geometries of the molecules of one or more creatures. The result is that the rearrangement of the target creature causes it to implode (collapse inward upon itself) or invert (its 
insides become its outsides and vice versa). The result is usually inversion, unless the target would not be adversely affected by 
this process (e.g., a slime, ooze, golem, elemental, etc.). In this case, implosion takes 
place. In either case, the effect kills/destroys the target instantaneously unless it makes a 
successful saving throw versus death magic at a -4 penalty. The caster can affect one creature per minute with this spell. After each round, the 
caster must make a Constitution check. If this fails, the caster is overwhelmed with the 
effort of sustaining the spell, at which time the spell terminates, leaving the caster
 stunned for 1-4 minutes. The maximum possible duration of the spell is 3 minutes.

 Name: Preservation
School\Sphere: Divine
Tier: 9
Range: 480 meters
Components: [Preservation] V , [Varies] S , [Varies] M 
Duration: 60 minutes
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: One structure
Effects of Spell: A building protected by preservation suffers only 25% of normal structural damage 
 from sources such as siege engines, earthquakes (both natural and magical), and powerful 
 weather-affecting spells. Spells which directly affect the physical integrity of the 
 structure (e.g., passwall, stone shape, transmute rock to mud) simply fail when cast on 
 the protected building.
 Preservation creates a permanent protection from enemies spell on the affected building. 
 Every surface of the building benefits from the effects of the spell.
 Magical spells allowing access to the building fail. Thus, creatures attempting to 
 teleport or fly into the building are stopped. Birds and creatures with natural flight may 
 enter the building normally. The preservation spell expires if the building is destroyed or after 60 minutes have 
 passed.
Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None

Saving Throw: None
Subtlety: None
Knockdown: None
Sensory: None 
Critical: None
Description: The ward matrix spell links as many as six locations. Only locations that have a functioning Wards spell may be linked. Ward matrix conjoins the different Wards spells so that each linked site gains the protection of all other wards in the network. From the place where the ward matrix is cast, magical connections spread to the other designated sites. These can be seen with a true seeing or similar spell as tendrils of magical energy running through the air just above ground level. The connections target their destinations and move toward them at a rate of 40 miles per turn. They can evade barriers such as anti-magic shells by moving above or around them. When the 
connections reach their destinations, they multiply and spread to connect all other 
locations in the network; this secondary linkage is established at a rate of 20 miles per 
turn.
The conjoining of Wards lasts for 60 days unless a linked area is destroyed or a 
Wards spell is dispelled. Any location that is destroyed or has its Wards spell dispelled is 
removed from the matrix; other connections remain intact for the duration.
